Sub pareDown()
'
'   This macro compares a new pricelist to the old pricelist of the same company.  If the old pricelist has
'   less than half the amount of parts in it, the new pricelist is pared down to match the old.  This determination can be done by human eyes, however, and is not done in the code.
'   Before activation of this macro, the old parts list should be quickly checked for size versus the size of the new parts list.
